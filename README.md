Project: Data Science and Logistic Regression

Development of a multi-class classifier using logistic regression to predict membership of one of the Hogwarts houses in the Harry Potter universe. 
In-depth data analysis and creation of visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, pair plots) to better understand feature distribution. 
Implementation of a one-vs-all logistic regression model with gradient descent, and realization of an automatic prediction program based on test datasets.
The project also explored concepts of Data Cleaning and Preparation, as well as optimization via stochastic gradient descent techniques.
